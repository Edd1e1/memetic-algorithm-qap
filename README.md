# Memetic Algorithm for Optimization (C++)

This repository implements a Memetic Algorithm that combines a Genetic Algorithm
with local search techniques to improve solution quality in combinatorial
optimization problems.

## Overview
The algorithm uses a Genetic Algorithm as a global search mechanism and applies
local improvement procedures to selected individuals, enhancing convergence and
solution refinement.

## Implemented Features
- Population-based Genetic Algorithm framework
- Selection, crossover, and mutation operators
- Elitism for preserving high-quality solutions
- Embedded local search applied to individuals
- Parameterized execution and batch evaluation on multiple instances

## Key Concepts
- Hybrid optimization (global + local search)
- Exploration vs. exploitation balance
- Improved convergence through local refinement

## Technologies
- C++
- Filesystem-based instance handling
- Randomized and heuristic optimization techniques

This project was developed for academic study of advanced evolutionary and
hybrid optimization algorithms.
